    <h1>Cities I've Lived In</h1>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in Colorado Springs. I moved to Boulder to go to CU for my freshman year of college. I hated CU and decided to transfer to CSU in Fort Collins and have lived here ever since.

    <h1>Cities I'd Like to Visit</h1>
    <p>
      I would like to visit New York because it's one of the cultural centers of the world. Amsterdam for the architecture and good times. Edinburgh because I've been there before and it's the coolest place ever.
